# Todo App
This is a simple and user-friendly to-do app that I developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows you to easily add and remove tasks, helping you keep track of your to-do list. It also displays the total number of tasks, so you can stay organized and focused on what needs to be done. This is a simple one I made when I was just starting out. :)
